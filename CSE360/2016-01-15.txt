Incremental vs Evolutionary models of development

Traditional
    Late
    Over budget
    Too many error
    Documentation focused
    Problems:
	Not focused on customers changing needs

Agile
    See manifesto for agile software development
	http://agilemanifesto.org/
    Characteristics:
	Effective response to change
	    Adaptive
	    Move Quickly
	Effective communication with all shareholders
	Drawing customer into the team
	Make the team be in control
	Use evolutionary and/or incremental models

    Process:
	Driven by customer descriptions
	Scenarios
	User stories
	Create short term plans
	Iterative process
	    Multiple deliveries
	Adaptive as change occurs

    Agile processes have a lower development cost as changes are introduced to
	the project as development schedule progress increases.

Human Factors
    Key Traits
	Communication
	Cooperation
	Self motivation
	Goal setting
	Make decisions
	Solve problems
	Trust and respect

Scrum
    Development work is partitioned into packets
	packets are called 'sprints'
    Testing and documentation are changing
    Iterative with focus developing working code
    Sprints have a focus on producing a working demo
    Sprints can pass or fail depending on if the objectives have been
	sufficiently met
    Entities:
	Product owner
	Scrum master
	    Literally enslaves the team
	Team members

    Scrum Overview (see slides)
	Product backlog
	Sprint backlog
	Sprint
	Working increment of the software
	    (potentially shippable version of software)

    Kanban exists
