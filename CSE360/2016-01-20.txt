Went over CSE360 programming style guide
    On blackboard. Course Information -> Coding and Documentation Requirements

	camelCase = camelBack notation
Also see documentation requirements in same location
    Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs
    Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs Javadocs
